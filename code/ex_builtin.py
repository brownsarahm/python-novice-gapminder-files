1. Predict what each of the `print` statements in the program below will `print`.
1. Does `max(len(rich), poor)` run or produce an error message? If it runs, does its result make any sense?

easy_string = "abc"
print(max(easy_string))
rich = "gold"
poor = "tin"
print(max(rich, poor))
print(max(len(rich), len(poor)))
max(len(rich), poor)

## Built-in Functions Excercise 2
If Python starts counting from zero, and len returns the number of characters in
 a string, what index expression will get the last character in the string name?
 (Note: we will see a simpler way to do this in a later episode.)

name = "yournamehere"
name[]
