## Library Excercise 1

What function from the math module can you use to calculate a square root without using sqrt?
Since the library contains this function, why does sqrt exist?


#  What would you need to do to check these Excercises?
# HINT: how could the %%writefile magic help?


## Library Excercise 2
# Change the order, add, and/or remove lines to make the following print out a
#  random base
bases="ACTTGCTTGAC"
import math
import random
len(bases)
len(bases)+1
math.floor(s1)
math.ceil(s1)
print("random base ",bases[])
random.random()*l


## Library Excercise 2
#Match the following print statements with the appropriate library calls.

#Print commands:

print("sin(pi/2) =",sin(pi/2))
print("sin(pi/2) =",m.sin(m.pi/2))
print("sin(pi/2) =",math.sin(math.pi/2))

#Library calls:

from math import sin,pi
import math
import math as m
from math import *
