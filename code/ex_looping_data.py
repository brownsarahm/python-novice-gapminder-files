## Data Looping Excercise 1
# Modify this program so that it prints the number of records in the file that has the fewest records.

import pandas
fewest = ____
for filename in glob.glob('data/*.csv'):
    dataframe = pandas.____(filename)
    fewest = min(____, dataframe.shape[0])
print('smallest file has', fewest, 'records')

## Data Looping Excercise 2

Write a program that reads in the regional data sets and plots the average GDP
per capita for each region over time in a single chart.

data_files_list = glob.___('')
mean_gdp = []
for file in data_file_list:
    df = pd.read_csv()
    mean_gdp.append()
    
mean_gdp_df = pd.DataFrame(data= , columns=)
