# ex0: split this into multiple cells and choose the either python or markdown for each

## Ex 1
# What is the final value of position in the program below? (Try to predict the value without running the program, then check your prediction.)
initial = "left"
position = initial
initial = "right"

## Ex 2
# If you assign a = 123, what happens if you try to get the second digit of a?
a=123


## Ex 3
Which is a better variable name, m, min, or minutes? Why? Hint: think about which code you would rather inherit from someone who is leaving the lab:

ts = m * 60 + s
tot_sec = min * 60 + sec
total_seconds = minutes * 60 + seconds

## Ex 4
# Think about what this will print before you uncomment and run it?
# atom_name = 'carbon'
# print('atom_name[1:3] is:', atom_name[1:3])
